[section:conversion Value Conversion]

While the __value__ container makes it easy to create ad-hoc structures,
often it is necessary to convert between JSON and specific user-defined
types. The library provides a set of customization points to enable
conversions between objects of type `T` and a JSON value:

* By specializing

* With free functions in the same namespace as `T`:
  * `void to_json( T const&, value& )`
  * `void from_json( T&, value const& )`

* Specializing __value_exchange__ for `T`, with static member functions:
  * `void value_exchange<T>::to_json( T const&, value& )` and
  * `void value_exchange<T>::from_json( T&, value const& )`

Only one of these mechanisms will be selected. If more than one is
available, the implementation prioritizes the specialization of
__value_exchange__ first, the free functions second, and the member
functions last.

[heading Member Functions]

The example code that follows uses the user-defined type `customer`,
declared thusly:

[snippet_exchange_1]

Since the author has control of the type, it uses member functions
to enable value exchange. An implementation of `to_json` may look
like this:

[snippet_exchange_2]

Turning a JSON value back into a customer is a bit more complicated,
as it must handle the case where the value does not have the necessary
keys, or if the values have the wrong kind. The implementation of
`from_json` throws an exception when the JSON value does not precisely
match the expected schema for customer:

[snippet_exchange_3]

Once value exchange is enabled for a type, it may be assigned and
stored:

[snippet_exchange_4]

[heading Trait Specialization]

Sometimes value exchange is needed, but the author cannot modify the
type in question to add member functions. One alternative is to
specialize __value_exchange__ for the type and provide the necessary
conversion functions. Here we enable value exchange for __std_complex__:

[snippet_exchange_5]

The implementation for `to_json` is straightforward:

[snippet_exchange_6]

As before, the implementation for `from_json` must use exceptions
to indicate that the value does not have the right schema:

[snippet_exchange_7]

Conversion to and from __std_complex__ is now possible:

[snippet_exchange_8]
